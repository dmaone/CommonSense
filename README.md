# CURIOSITY REQUIRED TO PROCEED
If you're not curious how this all works and "just want to convert your beamspring" - turn around now.

Nothing but sheer frustration lays on this path for you. This firmware/hardware is not for you, sorry about that.

Find someone how is curious about how things work or walked this path before and entice them to do it for you.

You have been warned.

## No warranties, expressed or implied.
You can fry the chip using this software. If you break it - you own *all* the parts.

If you cannot be relied on to understand written instructions - [here's one with pictures](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=21899), courtesy snackthecat @DT.

If you can't understand it even with pictures - close this page and *never* return. I don't want to be responsible if you electrocute yourself with +5V from USB.

It is not my purpose to "promote adoption" of this software. This is a controller for **my** keyboard. I use it daily, you can use it too if you're smart enough how to do it on your own (but see "no warranties" above) - but that's about it.

If you want to add tap dance macros, or RGB LED support, or "port it to QMK" - by all means, the "Fork" button is right over there. GPLv3 applies, so you MUST make your derivative works available. But please do not ask me to do it, because I explicitly WILL NOT.

There are two exceptions to the above, but you know who you are, because I explicitly promised you.

This is code-only repo, to keep it small. Instructions and pics are moved to [CSI](http://github.com/dmaone/CSI) repo to keep this repo nimble.
