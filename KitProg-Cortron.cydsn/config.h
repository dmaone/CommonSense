/*
 * if SELF_POWERED is defined - the device is self/battery-powered.
 * What does this mean:
 * \USB:VBUS\ pin MUST be assigned to one of the SIO pins (P12[0]-P12[7])
 * That pin must be connected to a point which is connected to VBUS
 * but deenergized when USB is disconnected.
 * NOTE: having a diode between device power rail and USB is not enough.
 * You must add a resistor between VBUS and the ground on USB side.
 * I experimented with 10kOhm - but that's 0.5mA which will make achieving
 * USB standby compliance pretty hard.
 * I think 100kOhm will work just fine - although you _may_ have to
 * increase POWER_CHECK_DELAY in PSoC_USB.c
 *
 * Also, if your power source is <3.6V (No, Li-ion/LiPoly are not <3.6V!)
 * you MUST set USB_POWER_MODE to USB_3V_OPERATION.
 * If you don't - USB will likely not work.
 * If you do and power from 5V though - you'll most likely fry USB regulator.
